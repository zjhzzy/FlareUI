# FlareUI

This is a UI library based on Qt, which offers modern and visually appealing controls and UI features, fully compatible with Qt's functionality and advantages. 



[Chinese](README.md)

## Project Description

This is a UI library that I suddenly thought of writing a few days ago when I had nothing to do. The FlareUI library is an extension of the Qt library. It is a solution for developers to reduce the use of Qss and avoid reinventing the wheel. It implements some controls based on the MacOS style.

## Features

1. Convenient API<br>For example, when writing programs, you don't have to rewrite controls for some tedious operations, just write a piece of code like this:

   ```cpp
   #include "FlareWindow.h"
   #include "PushButton.h"
   #include <QApplication>
   int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
   	Q_INIT_RESOURCE(FlareWindow);
   	QApplication a(argc, argv);
   	Flare::FlareWindow MainWindow;
   	Flare::PushButton button("Hello Falre!", &MainWindow);
   	MainWindow.resize(200, 200);
   	button.move(40,90);
   	button.resize(120, 20);
   	MainWindow.show();
   	return a.exec();
   }
   ```

   And you can achieve:

2. Based on the Mac style, normally implementing a style requires writing a lot of code, but here I have implemented it, so you can just "new" and enjoy the results.

## Development Environment

Using **Qt6.6.0**, but this is not very important because the code does not use any new features. It is based on QtWidget, and I am not very familiar with QML, so I didn't use it.

## Installation Guide

This will be written later. I've been fixing bugs for half a day and haven't finished yet.

## Usage Examples

I will write the usage examples on my blog, so there's no need to include them here.
